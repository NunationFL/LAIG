## Project information

- (items describing main strong points)
- Scene
  - The scene we want to create is a simple dinning table (and a chair) with some food like an apple and a donut in order to use all the primitives
  - There will also be a floor and a wall so the scene doesn't look too empty
  - (relative link to the scene)
